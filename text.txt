Goal: Gen AI Initiatives

Projects: RAG-Based Chatbot for Mortgage Operations & Snowflake Intelligence Agent for Marketing Analytics

Description:
Led two key Generative AI initiatives under the enterprise innovation roadmap:

Mortgage RAG Chatbot: Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Snowflake Cortex and Streamlit to help the Mortgage Operations team instantly retrieve information from over 541 Confluence documents. The solution replaced manual document searches with an AI assistant that delivers accurate, cited answers within seconds.

Snowflake Intelligence Agent: Built an AI Agent in Snowflake Cortex Analyst capable of interpreting natural language business questions on marketing campaign data and dynamically generating SQL queries and visualizations. The agent answered key descriptive questions such as “What are the total emails delivered for a specific campaign in Q3 2025?”

Impact:

Reduced information retrieval time for Mortgage Operations from minutes to under 10 seconds, improving staff productivity.

Increased answer relevance by 8% and context relevance by 12% across chatbot pilots (v1→v2).

Enabled self-service analytics for the Marketing team, cutting turnaround time for data requests and improving insight accessibility.

Established Snowflake AI observability metrics and a reusable AI agent framework for future business applications.

Key Metrics Tracked:

AI observability (Answer Relevance, Context Relevance, Groundedness)

User testing scores (Accuracy, Readability, Traceability, Latency)

Agent response latency and SQL interpretation accuracy (>90%)

Collaboration:

Worked with Tamera Jette for Confluence access, Shannon for documentation availability, and Ashlee & Scott from Sales and Underwriting for user testing.

Partnered with Leland (Sr. Director, Data Practices) for user evaluation reports and feedback tracking.

Collaborated with Srinivas Rachakonda to access email campaign dashboards and Snowflake queries for agent testing.

Coordinated with Marketing Analytics and Mortgage Operations teams to validate results and ensure alignment with business goals.

All findings and deliverables were reviewed and validated with Manager Zack and Assistant Manager Srini before stakeholder presentation.
