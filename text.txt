EDGE Values Self-Review
Engaged

Throughout this review period, I stayed fully engaged with First Tech’s mission by collaborating across teams, encouraging open feedback, and driving solutions that directly improved efficiency for business partners.

In the Payment Defender Strategy and Mortgage Operations Analysis, I worked closely with stakeholders like Jenica, Brent, and Anna to understand business pain points and translate them into actionable analytics.

I actively sought feedback from Zack and Srini at every stage to refine my analysis and ensure alignment with business expectations.

During the Gen AI Initiatives, I partnered with multiple departments (Mortgage, Marketing, Sales, and Data Practices) to co-create AI-driven solutions that empowered users and reduced manual effort.

By maintaining consistent communication and accountability, I helped bridge business and data science teams, ensuring that every project delivered measurable value and built trust across departments.

Dynamic

I embraced change and innovation through continuous learning and experimentation with new technologies.

As part of the Gen AI Initiatives, I led two pilots — the RAG-based Mortgage Chatbot and the Snowflake Intelligence Agent — which introduced Generative AI into business workflows for the first time at First Tech.

I proactively learned Snowflake Cortex, Streamlit, and Cortex Analyst to build scalable AI applications from the ground up.

When the Mortgage Operations project revealed data limitations, I adapted quickly by switching from predictive modeling to descriptive analytics, ensuring stakeholders still received actionable insights.

I remained flexible, resilient, and solution-oriented, always seeking innovative ways to enhance business efficiency and member experience through data-driven automation and AI integration.

Genuine

I take pride in fostering a genuine, respectful, and collaborative work culture.

I consistently recognized the contributions of my teammates — including Srinivas, Brent, and Anna — and ensured credit was shared across every project.

I maintained transparent communication with Zack and Srini, openly discussing challenges, learnings, and progress.

In projects like the Mortgage Chatbot pilot, I actively incorporated user feedback from Ashlee, Scott, and Tamera to refine usability and response accuracy, demonstrating empathy for end users’ needs.

By listening carefully, responding with integrity, and valuing every team member’s perspective, I helped strengthen collaboration and inclusivity within the Data Science and Mortgage Operations teams.

Summary

Across all four projects, I demonstrated the EDGE values through collaboration, adaptability, empathy, and innovation. Whether it was analyzing payment risk, enabling self-service analytics, or developing Generative AI tools, I remained committed to First Tech’s purpose — helping members succeed through data-driven solutions and genuine teamwork.
