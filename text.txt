Goal: Mortgage Operations

Project: Mortgage Modification Analysis

Description:
Conducted an in-depth analysis of mortgage modification requests to identify behavioral patterns and assess the feasibility of predictive modeling for early detection of members seeking loan modifications. Using historical mortgage data from 140 accounts (231 modification requests), the analysis segmented borrowers by generation, credit tier, SEG, and income to uncover trends in modification requests, approvals, and post-decision delinquency behavior.

Exploratory analysis revealed that Gen X borrowers (46%) had the highest request volume but low approval rates (2%), and 43% of requests came from Credit Tier F (<636), indicating elevated risk. Additionally, 38% of approved accounts still turned delinquent post-modification, showing limited repayment improvement. These insights highlighted that the dataset lacked consistent predictive signals, and the small sample size (only 9 approvals) made predictive modeling infeasible.

Despite this, the descriptive analytics provided actionable insights into member affordability issues, credit risk distribution, and denial reasons, helping stakeholders prioritize future data enrichment before predictive modeling.

Impact:

Delivered descriptive insights that improved understanding of mortgage holders’ modification behavior, credit-risk concentration, and approval likelihood by demographic segment.

Identified key data gaps and recommendations for feature enrichment, laying the groundwork for a future predictive pipeline.

Supported Mortgage Operations leadership in refining member outreach and policy alignment for high-risk segments.

Key Metrics Tracked:

Approval rate by generation, SEG, and credit tier

Post-decision delinquency (approved vs. denied)

Income distribution and DTI ratio patterns

Volume trends by year and request count per member

Observed Results:

No consistent predictive pattern across demographic or financial features.

Financial impact could not be quantified since no modified accounts transitioned to charge-off.

Provided clear data-driven recommendations to pause predictive modeling until data maturity improves.

Collaboration:
Collaborated with Brent Hauser and Anna Fowler from the Assets Management team to obtain and validate historical mortgage data for members seeking modifications.
Worked with Srinivas Rachakonda, Assistant Manager – Data Science, to understand the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) structure and data lineage, as this was my first project at First Tech Federal Credit Union.
Partnered with Mortgage Operations leadership to review findings and define next steps for data collection improvements.

Tools and Methods:

Snowflake (data extraction and cleaning)

Dataiku (data exploration, visualization, and segmentation analysis)

Statistical profiling and cohort-level descriptive analysis
