Project: Payment Defender Strategy – Float/Reversal Evaluation

Description:
Evaluated whether the new Payment Defender strategy reduces false float flags on legitimate credit-card transactions while maintaining strong detection of payment reversals. Back-tested 2024 card payments and reversals in Snowflake, reproduced both existing and new rule sets (rules shared by Velera), and built an evaluation pipeline in Dataiku to:

Classify transactions as float vs. no-float under each strategy.

Score each strategy on its ability to flag potential reversals and to catch reversals that progress to 60+ DPD delinquency and charge-off.

Run a tree-based parameter search across eight controllable thresholds to identify optimal operating ranges by segment (risk tier and transaction volume).

Analyze the relationship between float flags and member complaints to quantify downstream experience impact.

Impact:

Produced a clear policy recommendation: keep the existing strategy for high-risk scenarios where maximum reversal detection (higher recall) is critical; use the new strategy for high-volume, low-risk transactions to reduce false alarms and improve member experience.

Established guardrails and segment-level thresholds that product and operations can implement without architecture changes.

Created a repeatable evaluation framework in Dataiku/Snowflake for future strategy A/B tests and quarterly reviews.

Key Metrics Tracked:

False-flag rate (FPR) on legitimate payments

Recall of payment reversals, specifically those that progress to 60+ DPD and charge-off

Precision of reversal detection (quality of alerts)

Alert volume per 1,000 transactions and associated investigation workload

Member complaint correlation with float flags

Time-to-funds-availability impact (member experience)

Observed Results (Directionally):

Existing strategy: higher recall for reversals but more false positives.

New strategy: fewer false flags and better member experience, with some loss in reversal detection coverage.

Collaboration:

Partnered with Senior Analyst, Consumer Lending to acquire and validate the credit-card payments and reversals dataset.

Worked with Jenica H., Director of Card Services, to align on definitions of fraud, float, and reversal and to confirm risk priorities by segment.

Incorporated rule documentation from Velera to faithfully implement the “new strategy” logic.

Tools and Methods:

Snowflake (data storage, SQL back-tests), Dataiku (pipelines, parameter search), Tree-based search for threshold tuning, confusion-matrix-based evaluation with segment cuts.
